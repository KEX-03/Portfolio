# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my frontend development skills, projects, and approach to building web interfaces.

The portfolio is intentionally minimal and focuses on clarity, usability, and real-world project execution rather than visual excess.

## About

I’m a frontend-focused web developer building practical, user-centered web interfaces using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I focus on understanding how things work under the hood, writing maintainable code, and finishing complete, deployable projects. My current goal is to strengthen my frontend foundation through hands-on work while gradually expanding toward full-stack development.
